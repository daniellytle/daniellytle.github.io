The time between jobs is a great chance for a long adventure. In the fall of 2021 I set out from NYC on my sailboat bound for warmer climates. I had done a bit of research into route planning and passages by chatting with friends and finding other blogs similar to this one. In this post I'll detail the route I took and interesting points of note from along the way.

I waited a while to make this post so I don't remember much from the voyage but [here is a summary video I made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxqqYmYuUlI&t=1s) and the following sailing segments:

* Leg 1: NYC to Cape May, NJ
* Leg 2: Cape May, NJ to Ocean City, MD
* Leg 3: Ocean City, MD to Norfolk, VA
* Leg 4: Norfolk, VA to Waterside Marina
* Leg 5: Waterside Marina to Dismal Swamp Welcome Center
* Leg 6: Dismal Swamp Welcome Center to Alligator River
* Leg 7: Alligator River to Neuse River
* Leg 8: Neuse River to Morehead City, NC
* Leg 9: Morehead City, NC to Camp Lejune
* Leg 10: Camp Lejune to Wrightsville Beach, NC
