I'm starting this site to keep track of the various curious things that happen during my life. I'm currently 24 years old, climate change is scaring everyone, people say the American political system is broken. The latest exciting news for people my age is a viral campaign to invade Area 51. Change is happening quickly and this change is most likely why people feel these are stranger times than any other.

This blog will be a place for me to publish myself essentially. If all goes to plan, I'll make interesting points and influence others, I'll make errors and adjustments.

Truthfully I've been inspired by [Hannah](https://twitter.com/ahealthyhan) and [Chuckry](https://chuckry.substack.com/).
