I was looking for an easy way to hold my paddleboard of to the side of my boat but couldn't believe
how expensive the available options were. [This Magma surf rack holder](https://www.amazon.com/Magma-Products-R10-626-Polished-Stainless/dp/B00MNQSHFE/ref=pd_lpo_2?pd_rd_i=B00MNQSHFE&psc=1)
is nice and solid but $270? I figured I'd try to piece together a cheaper option and started looking for the bare pieces.

I found this [Garage roof SUP holder piece](amazon.com/gp/product/B086KVCCSR) for around $30 and figured it wouldn't be hard to attach it to the stanchions on
on the side of the boat.

Then I used two [SeaDog rail clamps](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TUNSR9Y)
to connect the U-bend piece to the stanchions. The result was a solid paddleboard holder at a fraction of the price!
