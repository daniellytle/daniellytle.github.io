I once met a man named David Bowen, he was sailing with a friend from the Chesapeake Bay down to the Bahamas. We got to talking about adventures and life and he told me his way of living a happy one. He told me:

### "Write down three things you want to do, then do them"

This blog is dedicated to that method of living.
