    <p>I’m starting this site to keep track of the various curious things that happen during my life.

<p>This blog will be a place for me to publish myself essentially. If all goes to plan, I’ll make interesting points and influence others, I’ll make errors and adjustments.</p>

<p>Truthfully I’ve been inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/ahealthyhan">Hannah</a> and <a href="https://chuckry.substack.com/">Chuckry</a>.</p>
