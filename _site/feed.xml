I’m currently 24 years old, climate change is scaring everyone, people say the American political system is broken. The latest exciting news for people my age is a viral campaign to invade Area 51. Change is happening quickly and this change is most likely why people feel these are stranger times than any other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog will be a place for me to publish myself essentially. If all goes to plan, I’ll make interesting points and influence others, I’ll make errors and adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;
